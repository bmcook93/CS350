# CS350
CS-350 Emerging System Architecture and Technologies


  The intention of this project was to create a smart thermostat using a Raspberry Pi. It teaches the versatility and challenges of embedded systems development in troubleshooting both code and hardware. I did well in building the circuit for the thermostat; taking my time and triple checking each step ensured that I wasn't spending excessive time ironing out bugs in the connections with peripheral devices. I believe I could improve in the code, making it run more efficiently and handle events better, such as the transition between meeting the set temperature and being off of it by a few degrees - there are a few bugs to work out in this when switching between heating and cooling mode. I used neovim for editing, which I will be adding to my network of tools for remote programming. From this course, I learned how to be innovating and creative when writing code, how to better read through existing code to understand what I am writing and how it will interact with the program, and how circuit boards are built. This will transfer well over to other projects and works, as I have the skills required to understand the inner workings of a project and to break it down into smaller pieces. Ensuring that the code was well commented and efficient keeps the project maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
